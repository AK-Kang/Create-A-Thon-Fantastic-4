# HoPENet
Our project is a resource website targeted at organizations, volunteers, and people in-need which connects them around the topic of homelessness. It provides each with the resources to meet their needs and creates a collaborative environment. It also predicts homelessness statistics in an area and an individual's risk of homelessness.
